# Changelog

All notable changes to BeeMemoryBank will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Near-realtime sync (push-on-save):** SyncTrigger signals immediate sync after every save, reducing sync delay from 60 seconds to near-instant between public nodes
- **Push position tracking:** New `tbl_sync_push_position` table tracks what was sent to each remote node (vs pull position which tracks what was received)
- **Sync delivery status endpoint:** `GET /api/sync/delivery-status` returns per-node push progress (lastPushedSeq, totalLocalEvents, isSynced, lastContactAt)
- **Lightweight ping endpoint:** `GET /api/sync/ping?afterSequence=N` — returns 204 (no new events) or 200 with count; no auth required
- **Sync status UI in Web header:** Badge with pending node count, click to expand per-node delivery details
- **Post-save sync toast:** After saving an article, a toast shows per-node sync delivery circles (green=synced, yellow=pending); click to open detailed modal
- Encrypted image storage with per-image DEK (AES-256-GCM), same envelope encryption as articles
- Image upload in Web UI editor: drag & drop, clipboard paste, and toolbar button via EasyMDE
- Image display in article view with URL rewriting through Web proxy
- API endpoints: `POST /api/media` (upload), `GET /api/media/{id}` (download with on-the-fly decryption)
- Media files included in snapshots (TAR archive with SHA256 hashes, manifest v2)
- Snapshot restore now recovers media files alongside the database
- Sync events for media: `media_create` and `media_delete` with Base64-encoded ciphertext
- Automatic cleanup: soft-deleted media purged after 30 days, orphaned uploads after 24 hours
- Browser caching for media: `Cache-Control: private, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- Full-text search across encrypted article bodies with batched decryption (50 articles per batch)
- Separate MCP tool `bee_search_content` for body content search (slow, opt-in)
- Content search checkbox on Web search page (unchecked by default)
- Content search toggle on Mobile articles page with 1-second debounce
- Docker Compose deployment tested and verified
- Screenshots section in README (Web themes, Mobile app)

### Security

- **Delivery-status endpoint** protected by `InternalKeyValidator` (prevents node topology exposure)
- **Ping endpoint integer overflow fix:** removed `(int)` cast on `afterSequence` parameter (long values >2B were truncated)
- **XSS fix in sync toast:** node `displayName` now HTML-escaped in title attributes
- Admin endpoints (user management, lock) now require `BMB_INTERNAL_KEY` shared secret between Web and API, preventing role spoofing via HTTP headers
- Admin page and proxy routes restricted to `superadmin` role (cookie-based auth)
- `ApiClient` reads role from cookie claims per-request instead of a mutable singleton field
- Revoked sync nodes now correctly rejected by `GetByNodeIdAsync` (status filter added)

### Changed

- SyncScheduler now uses `SemaphoreSlim(1,1)` concurrent guard to prevent overlapping sync cycles
- SyncScheduler resilient to exceptions: catches and logs errors instead of crashing the background service
- SyncClient push now filters by local `node_id` — no longer sends remote-origin events back to their source (reduces wasted traffic)
- `DeliveryNodeStatus.TotalLocalEvents` changed from `int` to `long` to support large event logs
- `bee_search` MCP tool now performs fast metadata-only search (title/tags)
- Web search defaults to metadata-only; content search is opt-in via checkbox
- SearchService uses batched processing instead of loading all articles at once
- EventApplier now supports file system access for media sync (writes .enc files to disk)
- Snapshot manifest bumped to v2 when media files are present
